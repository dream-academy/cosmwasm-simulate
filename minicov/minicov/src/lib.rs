//! This crate provides code coverage support for `no_std` and embedded programs.
//!
//! This is done through a modified version of the LLVM profiling runtime (normally
//!     part of compiler-rt) from which all dependencies on libc have been removed.
//!     
//! All types of instrumentation using the LLVM profiling runtime are supported:
//! - Rust code coverage with `-Cinstrument-coverage`.
//! - Rust profile-guided optimization with `-Cprofile-generate`.
//! - Clang code coverage with `-fprofile-instr-generate -fcoverage-mapping`.
//! - Clang profile-guided optimization with `-fprofile-instr-generate`.
//! - Clang LLVM IR profile-guided optimization with `-fprofile-generate`.
//!
//! Note that to profile both C and Rust code at the same time you must use Clang
//! with the same LLVM version as the LLVM used by rustc. You can pass these flags
//! to C code compiled with the `cc` crates using [environment variables].
//!
//! [environment variables]: https://github.com/rust-lang/cc-rs#external-configuration-via-environment-variables
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! Note: This crate requires a recent nightly compiler.
//!
//! 1. Ensure that the following environment variables are set up:
//!
//! ```sh
//! export RUSTFLAGS="-Cinstrument-coverage -Zno-profiler-runtime"
//! ```
//!
//! Note that these flags also apply to build-dependencies and proc
//! macros by default. This can be worked around by explicitly
//! specifying a target when invoking cargo:
//!
//! ```sh
//! # Applies RUSTFLAGS to everything
//! cargo build
//!
//! # Doesn't apply RUSTFLAGS to build dependencies and proc macros
//! cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
//! ```
//!
//! 2. Add the `minicov` crate as a dependency to your program:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! minicov = "0.2"
//! ```
//!
//! 3. Before your program exits, call `minicov::capture_coverage` which returns
//!    a `Vec<u8>` and dump its contents to a file with the `.profraw` extension:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! fn main() {
//!     // ...
//!
//!     let coverage = minicov::capture_coverage();
//!     std::fs::write("output.profraw", coverage).unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! If your program is running on a different system than your build system then
//! you will need to transfer this file back to your build system.
//!
//! 4. Use a tool such as [grcov] or llvm-cov to generate a human-readable coverage
//! report:
//!
//! ```sh
//! grcov output.profraw -b ./target/debug/my_program -s . -t html -o cov_report
//! ```
//!
//! [grcov]: https://github.com/mozilla/grcov
