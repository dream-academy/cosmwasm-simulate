# Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

We try to keep the range of supported Rust compiler versions as wide as possible
to avoid unnecessary inconvenience for contract developers. However, we give up
all strong MSRV guarantees as the Rust ecosystem currently makes it impossible
to do so. See e.g.
